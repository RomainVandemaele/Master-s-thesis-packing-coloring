The main result of this paper is a solution of an open problem of Goddard etal. showing that the decision whether a tree allows a packing coloring with at most k classes is NP-complete. We further discuss specific cases when this problem allows an efficient algorithm. Namely, we show that it is decideable in polynomial time for graphs of bounded treewidth and diameter, and fixed parameter tractable for chordal graphs. We accompany these results by several observations on a closely related variant of the packing coloring problem, where the lower bounds on the distances between vertices inside color classes are determined by an infinite nondecreasing sequence of bounded integers.

Some of such subgraphs are related to the celebrated Strong Perfect Graph Theorem, as it implies that every graph G contains a clique of size χ(G), or an odd hole or an odd anti-hole as an induced subgraph. In this paper, we investigate the impact of induced maximal cliques, odd holes and odd anti-holes on the polytope associated with a new 0–1 integer programming formulation of the graph coloring problem. We show that they induce classes of facet defining inequalities. "

In this work, the 0–1 integer programming formulation based on representative vertices is revisited to remove symmetry. The previous polyhedral study related to the original formulation is adapted and generalized. New versions of facets derived from substructures of G are presented, including cliques, odd holes and anti-holes and wheels. In addition, a new class of facets is derived from independent sets of G. Finally, a comparison with the independent sets formulation is provided. "

The equitable coloring problem consists of finding the minimum value of k such that a given graph can be equitably k -colored. We present two new integer programming formulations based on representatives for the equitable coloring problem. We propose a primal constructive heuristic, branching strategies, and the first branch-and-cut algorithm in the literature of the equitable coloring problem. The computational experiments were carried out on randomly generated graphs, \{DIMACS\} graphs, and other graphs from the literature. "

abstract = "Abstract The frequency assignment problem asks for assigning frequencies to transmitters in a wireless network and includes a variety of specific subproblems. In particular, the packing coloring problem comes from the regulations concerning the assignment of broadcast frequencies to radio stations. The problem is placed on a graph-theoretical footing and modeled as the packing chromatic number χ ρ ( G ) of a graph G. The packing chromatic number of G is the smallest integer k such that the vertex set V ( G ) can be partitioned into disjoint classes X 1 , … , X k , with the condition that vertices in X i have pairwise distance greater than i. The determination of the packing chromatic number is known to be NP-hard. This paper presents an integer linear programming model and a satisfiability test model for the packing coloring problem. The proposed models were applied for studying the packing chromatic numbers of Cartesian products of paths and cycles and for the packing chromatic numbers of some distance graphs."}

We generalize results given by Ekstein et al. for graphs D ( 1 , t ) . For sufficiently large t we prove that χ ρ ( D ( k , t ) ) ≤ 30 for both k and t odd, and that χ ρ ( D ( k , t ) ) ≤ 56 for exactly one of k and t odd. We also give some upper and lower bounds for χ ρ ( D ( k , t ) ) with small k and t . "

colors cannot be used as freely as lower numbered colors. In addition
there is a correspondence between the eccentricity (max distance) of a
vertex and the highest legal color for that vertex.
In this note we investigate eccentric coloring of trees. We give the ec-
centric chromatic number or a bound on the eccentric chromatic number
for several simple classes of trees. In particular we show the eccentric
chromatic number for paths (χ e = 3), spiders (χ e = 3) and caterpillars
(χ e ≤ 7).
Further, we discuss the eccentric chromatic number of complete k-ary
trees and show that the complete binary trees have eccentric chromatic
number χ e ≤ 7. We also show that large binary trees are eccentrically col-
orable and have χ e ≤ 7. We then conclude by showing that no complete
k-ary tree, k ≥ 3, is eccentrically colorable. "
